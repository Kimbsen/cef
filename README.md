# cef
Go bindings for the [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef).

Run `setup.sh` in this directory to pull the version of CEF these bindings were created for. The exact version can be updated in that script file by changing the `CEF_VERSION` variable.

https://github.com/richardwilkes/webapp and https://github.com/richardwilkes/webapp-example use these bindings to create desktop applications.
